                            <p>Yes. It takes about 8 weeks for extractions, 8 weeks for the remainder of the processing, and 2 weeks to do the actual sequencing. This is before any analysis and if everything goes as planned, with no delays - equipment down, run failures, reagents or other consumables back ordered. Things do sometimes go wrong, so we say up to 6 months.</p>

                        <p>Each tube is used for <strong>one sample</strong>. The tube has two swabs in it because one is a backup in case the DNA does not amplify on the first swab.</p>

                        <div class="faq_content">
                        <p>You have two options:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Send us the samples as you collect them. We will put them on ice and take care of them until we can process them.</li>
                            <li>Keep them in your freezer and send us all your samples at the same time. <strong>If you choose this option, please note that you should avoid repeated freeze/thaw cycles (i.e., once they're frozen, keep them frozen). This means that when you ship them (preferably overnight), you should keep them cold (e.g., with gel packs).</strong></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>We recommend option 1 since there are fewer opportunities to make a mistake and you will get the best quality data out of your samples that way, but it does involve more postage. It's up to you!</p>
